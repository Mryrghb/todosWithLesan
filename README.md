Working with the LESAN framework was an interesting experience.
For me, who had a brief knowledge of the structure and operation of SQL and NOSQL, it was like, oh God, how good it is that I manage all the relations myself (more than what is the case in SQL),
in fact in the LESAN has done less but more accurate work
, and it seems smoother to work with it - with LESAN,
you can implement more personal handwriting on the codes.
